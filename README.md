# Hi there 
- I am James Ling, A PhD candidate in the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
- My research focus is advanced monitoring in diabetes patient, although i have a broader interest in applying data science
in wide specturm of health care. I am happy to contribute my skills and knowledge in achieving a better health care delivery
as well as improving care outcome.

## Learning and skills
- I am an experienced R user, and have a scratch in the Python environment. Besides, i am familiar with common BI tools like excel and Tableau.
- My "bibles" on Data Science are: R for data science (2nd edition, https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), and Introduction to Statistical Learning (2nd edition,
https://www.statlearning.com/). I strongly suggest everyone who are intereseted in developing data science skills should read them.
- I am experienced in tidyverse and applied Bayes modelling using stan. My research do require only a little machine learning, but I am familiar
with the concepts of them.
- Currently, I am learning how to present some of my findings via Github (That's why you see this page!). Also, I am learning on Shiny to 
allow interactive presentation.

## Interests
